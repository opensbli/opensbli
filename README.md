# OpenSBLI
Internal development branch
OpenSBLI-V2.0 is an automatic code generator which expands a set of equations written in Einstein notation, and writes out the finite difference code in the OPSC language.

## Getting started

### Dependencies
First ensure that the following dependencies are satisfied:
#### Core code-generation:
The following dependencies are required for generating a code and running a simulation:

* Python 2.7
* Sympy >= 1.0
* Numpy
* Scipy 0.19.1
* OPS (to target the generated OPSC code towards different backends) [OPS project's repository](https://github.com/gihanmudalige/OPS).

#### Testing and documentation:

* pytest (for running the test suite)
* python-flake8 (for linting the code base)
* Sphinx (to build the documentation)

#### Note on previous version

* The version 1.0 of OpenSBLI can be downloaded from [release](https://github.com/opensbli/opensbli/releases)
* No enhancements of version 1.0 are planned

#### Postprocessing:

* Matplotlib for plot scripts
* python-h5py

## Installation

### Development branch
